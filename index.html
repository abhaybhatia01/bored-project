                    This was created with the sole intention of learning. .. 
                    it's kind of creapy now that i think of itüòÇ.. but mehhh..  who cares...  
                    And these things are fairly hard to make, so better be greatful. too bad you will probably not goona get to see this one. 
                    <span>HAPPY BIRTHDAY</span>.. now act like a big girl.. good luck on your college. wish you the best.

                    Sometimes I wonder, though..
                    <br> Are you always this happy when you talk to someone...? because You sure know how to make someone feel special and  Did i ever tell you that you're perfect.. ??
                    <br> Each of us lives in our own reality.. One day you think of something in a way... You wake up the next day, and your way of thinking can be totally different.. Sometimes it takes years to make it different.. It's hard to express sometimes.. But when you go through this process, you don't realize it...
                    <br> i happen to be a boy who gets influenced by its company very easily.. Or in other words, you can say.. I am the kind of boy who likes to learn from people.. And I am 99.9 % sure that i am ridiculously influenced by you.. And i take no shame in that.. Because i am also 'it is what it is ' kind of guy.
                    <br> The reason i am telling you this is because.... i wanted to let you know. that i understand where you come from and why you act the way you do... And also because I like writing things down.. Old habitüòÇ But fuck you for not being polite enough. I usually don't complain about things too.. But this is also one of many inherited traits from you. .Finally, i have realized that you are not perfect.. But the problem is.. I like imperfections nowüò©.. Like those moles.. I truly am fucked.
                    <br> Also, I have a confession to make.. I may have added you to my prayers one or two times.. You think you're above doing it, but one time you let yourself do it, and you're doomed. It was like, "Usko akkl do thodi si." It was a long time ago.. But still... i don't feel right about it.
                    <br> Last minute changes--- 
                    <br>There is so much stuff that I don't wanna tell you, and you wouldn't wanna listen to it. So... I deleted that stuff because we are not talking so.. bottom line is.. I like you, and that doesn't happen to me a lot. just want to make clear that it does not mean that you have to hold back to do anything. i just want to see you more stronger. because now that i am at home now.. i have realised that things can get pretty tough.. don't know why things are this way between us but we can talk anytime.. don't know why i am this way but again 'it is what it is'..
                    <br>Well, I read your birthday speech... You have a special way of touching my heart. You have grown into a Responsible woman. You're not the same Molly who used to tell me that you haven't pooped in 2 days... You're now the girl who takes responsibility for her decisions and consequences. The thing I like is the honesty. I've seen girls fake things out just to make others like them. don't change in that manner. Please make others feel the same way about you as I do. It really burns my heart now that I've started writing things down.
                    <br>Even if you're not 100% honest with me, or even if you clear your intentions by giving totally different validation so that it does not hurt me, if these are the cases, then I just want to say it's fine to be that way and don't need to feel guilty about it. and if not, then I am just overthinking and forget what I just said.
                    <br> okay its enough now.
